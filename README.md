# Turkish-twitter-politician-analysis
In this project, I have written a machine learning model that determines whether the tweets about politicians are positive or negative.
Then, I used the model to predict which politicians are liked more by Turkish people. There are some interesting data, so I recommend you to at least check out the graphs.
You can reach out the dataset I have used [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/winvoker/turkish-sentiment-analysis-dataset). I have filtered some to use in this project.
## Preprocessing Our Data
I will be using the [Zemberek](https://github.com/ahmetaa/zemberek-nlp) library to process our data. Zemberek is a natural language processing (NLP) tool for Turkish language.
The steps that I will be using are:
* Sentence normalization
* Removing punctuations, mentions, digits and emojis
* Tokenization
* Removing stop words
* Lemmatization

```python
data["text"] = data["text"].apply(lambda x: str(normalizer.normalize(JString(x))))
data["text"] = data["text"].apply(lambda x: "".join([i for i in x if i not in string.punctuation]))
data["text"] = data["text"].apply(lambda x: "".join([i for i in x if not i.isdigit()]))
data["text"] = data["text"].apply(lambda x: tokenize(x))
data["text"] = data["text"].apply(lambda x: [i for i in x if i not in stop_words])
data["text"] = data["text"].apply(lambda x: [lemmatize(i) for i in x])
data["text"] = data["text"].apply(lambda x: " ".join([i for i in x]))
```

## Visualizing the Data
I will be using matplotlib library in python to visualize our data.

### Negative - Positive Balance

We can see from the graph that we have a nice balance in our data.

### Most Used Words

Seems pretty reasonable. Nothing interesting here.

#### Most Used Word Combinations (Bigram)

Now that is interesting. Most used 2-word combinations are "orospu Ã§ocuk" and "am koy". Since we lemmatized the data, it shows the lemmatized version of very common bad words.
What if don't lemaatize?

All right. That is pretty dark. I guess we can conclude that Turkish Twitter community is pretty toxic.

#### Most Used Word Combinations (Trigram)

Event though I can pretty much predict the results now, I wanted the see the trigram graph too. At this point, not really interesting.
